1. Comment out all debug signals from "Debug Signal" to "Generated Code Ends" 
    - these are waveform visualization signals generated by makerchip

2. At the bottom of the file, comment out all of code loops with viz signals after the comment "7-Segment"
    - these are visualiztion signals for the FPGA lab and VIZ GUI in makerchip

3. Comment out the all of the assign statement for slidswitch, sseg etc. immediatly after the "Generated Code Ends"
    - these are used on the TT FPGA demo board to connect the 7-segment and slide switch signals
