1. Comment out all debug signals from "Debug Signal" to "Generated Code Ends" 
    - these are waveform visualization signals generated by makerchip

2. At the bottom of the file, comment out all of code loops with viz signals after the comment "7-Segment"
    - these are visualiztion signals for the FPGA lab and VIZ GUI in makerchip

3. Comment out the all of the assign statement for slidswitch, sseg etc. immediatly after the "Generated Code Ends"
    - these are used on the TT FPGA demo board to connect the 7-segment and slide switch signals

4. Comment out the 'top' module
    - 'top' is needed in makerchip and is the test bench generator. makerchip will yell at you if you try
       and remove it in source TL-V. This should clear up some linter warnings

5. Change IMEM initilization from address # to all 0's
    - initial it initilizes everything to the respective address number for debugging but need to change it to all 0's

6. Get rid of any use of `BOGUS_USE() from TL-V
    - macro isn't expanded sometimes for the ASIC flow from makerchip

7. uio_out and uio_oe should only have one driver
    - there are potential for a multiple driver mishap once code is generated fro TL-V because of the boiler plate FPGA wrapper
